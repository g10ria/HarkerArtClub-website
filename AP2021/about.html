            <br>
            The AP Studio Art Sustained Investigation is a year-long development of a body of artwork based on a central
            theme. Students determine a conceptual point of focus and investigate it by creating works that address
            three main concerns: <span class="diff">Ideas</span> (what the artwork communicates), <span class="diff">Materials</span> (the physicality and significance of
            their medium) and <span class="diff">Process</span> (their engagement with materials in pursuit of their idea).
            <br>
            <br>

            The suites of images in this online exhibition are a snapshot of each student’s larger, currently unfinished
            bodies of work. A midpoint in the process, this show gives students the opportunity to reflect on their
            trajectory. Seeing their work exhibited allows students to witness the existence of their work in the world
            outside of their studios and is instrumental in refining their vision for the final portfolio.
