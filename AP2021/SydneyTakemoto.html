                    What is ADD actually like? Is it less focus? Just daydreaming? My investigation focuses on the
                    neurodivergent experience I have had with Attention Deficit Disorder., and the range of effects it
                    has in every-day life. Many view the disability as just a learning or developmental challenge;
                    however, it is much more than that. The effects, insecurities, and experiences I have lived with,
                    inside and outside the classroom, have taught me a lot about what it means to be neurodivergent
                    versus how it is viewed.

                    Through my work, I tell my story, reflective of the millions of moments, through illustrated pieces.
                    With expressive abstraction, utilizing the visual elements of water color that I convert to a
                    digital mosaic, I depict experiences drawn from my daily life. I use the colors and lines to depict
                    how I feel during or when looking at these certain situations; as many of the moments are broader, I
                    use color variety to express the complexity of the feeling; on the more intense side of emotions, I
                    use warm colors like red. Through a visual experience, I aim to expand views on what it means to be
                    neurodivergent and raise ideas of what it means to have Attention Deficit Disorder.
