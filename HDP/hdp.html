            <h2>Honors Directed Portfolios - 2020</h2>
            <div class="desc">
                As with all other facets of our lives these days, Honors Directed Portfolio students had to pivot their ideas and
                working strategies to adapt to the confines of making art at home. With the loss of the seminal culminating exhibition
                on our physical campus in The Shah Gallery, HDP students creatively addressed the possibilities of sharing their
                semester’s work with our school community. In the video and links below, learn about how the Spring 2020 Honors Directed
                Portfolio students dealt with COVID-19’s shelter-in-place reality and how this influenced their ideas about making and
                sharing their art.

                            This painting series was initially inspired by my experience watching a close friend struggle with body
                            dysmorphia. The
                            final body of work I produced, titled “Ego Death,” is meant to confront the complexity of identity and
                            the fragility of
                            self-image. Ego Death, or the complete loss of subjective self-identity, is something that I believe we
                            all experience
                            in small ways. One of the major challenges we all face is cultivating a strong sense of self and
                            accepting ourselves
                            with all our virtues, idiosyncrasies, and most of all, physical imperfections. This body of work
                            represents that ongoing
                            struggle and encourages viewers to look inwards, instead of focusing on the inconsequential physical
                            flaws they perceive
                            in themselves.

                            Initially, I came into this semester wanting to explore how people affect objects. I wanted to take the theme of
                            interaction from my last semester’s exhibition even further and push the boundaries between participant and artist. I
                            was also drawn to the idea of preciousness; from an artist's perspective I wanted to release the impulse to save my
                            works from change or existence. I knew I wanted to play with destruction as a way for the viewer to take a more active
                            role in my art. I assumed that the viewer would interact with my work physically displayed in The Shah Gallery.

                            This past year, I explored the female experience. As I am growing up and becoming an adult and a woman, I wanted to
                            reevaluate my relationship with my femininity and how that relationship has been affected by the depiction of women in
                            the media I consume. Prior to the shelter in place, I wanted to focus on the depiction of women in art, but when I
                            switched from making Cyanotypes to sewing, my focus shifted to the modern depiction of women in media like film. My
                            pre-quarantine work explores the emphasis on sexuality within art’s history, and how this depiction has developed over
                            time and influenced the way women are presented in media today. My post-quarantine work is inspired by the concept of
                            the Manic Pixie Dream Girl. I wanted to create a closet for an individual woman, full of personalities that played into
                            the fantasies of men. Both of these projects remain unfinished due to the current circumstances, but I hope that you
                            contemplate the nuances of female depiction in the media as you view the following work.
